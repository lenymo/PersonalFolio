#My personal portfolio site

---

This started out as an attempt to build a responsive HTML / CSS / Javascript menu which would use the same core markup while responding and behaving differently at various different breakpoints. It soon evolved into my portfolio site and I used it as a tool to experiment with Git, Sass, JS, jQuery and JSON.
