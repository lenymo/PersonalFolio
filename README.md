#My personal portfolio site

This started out as an attempt to build a responsive HTML / CSS / Javascript menu which would use the same core markup while responding and behaving differently at various different breakpoints. It soon evolved into my portfolio site and I used it as a tool to experiment with Git, Sass, JS, jQuery and JSON. You can see my portfolio at [clinch.com.au](http://clinch.com.au).



##Technology used

###PHP
Largely for templating.

###SASS
I had previously used LESS but wanted to get stuck into SASS and learn more about CSS pre-processors.

###HTML5
I experimented with <video>, used <section>, <header>, <nav> and various other semantic tags.

###jQuery
I've used jQuery a lot over the years but I wanted to try some neat things here. As an example, the navigation bar has a fixed once the user scrolls past the first <section> of each page. On top of that, based on a class on each <section> the nav bar will dynamically change as you scroll up and down (or resize the browser). 

Other uses for jQuery included using the .getJSON / .ajax function to pull in my Dribble shots, Instagram photos, and last.fm top plays from their respective APIs.
