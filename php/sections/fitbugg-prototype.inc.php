								Interactive Prototyping

							<p>
								As I began creating mockups, I came across <a href="https://medium.com/@ideeeedit/why-we-want-to-be-obsolete-29486245858b" target="_blank" title="Why we want to become obsolete">this article</a> on Medium, which lead me to become a Prott Beta Tester. I immediately saw the massive potential of such tools but <a href="https://prottapp.com/" target="_blank" title="Prott rapid prototyping for mobile apps">Prott</a> was a young product and wasn't ready for client scrutiny. 
							</p>
							<p>
								I tried other options before settling on <a href="https://www.flinto.com/" target="_blank" title="Flinto prototyping tool">Flinto</a>, which is currently the most mature and dependable tool.
							</p>
							<p>
								I eventually created multiple interactive prototype using 130+ high res PNGs. The IP surrounding these prototypes prevents me from linking to them, but here's a short video of how it works:

								I loved creating this prototype. It allowed me to design interactions which previously would have been impossible without heavy use of JS. 
							</p>
							<p>
								It's great as a beta testing tool, and with minimal effort it gives clients a tangible product to play with and provide feedback on. For mobile UI and UX design, I highly recommend Flinto.
